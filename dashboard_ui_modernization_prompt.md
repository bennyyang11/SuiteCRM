# SuiteCRM Dashboard UI Modernization - AMP Prompt

## **Problem Statement**
The current SuiteCRM dashboard system has critical UX issues:
- All dashboards (Sales, Marketing, Activity, Collaboration) look identical
- No visual indication of which dashboard tab is active
- Dashboards are too simplistic (just calendar widgets)
- Demo data is not effectively displayed to showcase functionality
- Poor differentiation between different business modules

## **Modernization Requirements**

### **1. Dashboard Differentiation & Branding**

**Create distinct visual identities for each dashboard:**

```
Sales Dashboard:
- Color scheme: Blue (#2196F3) and green (#4CAF50) for revenue
- Icons: Dollar signs, charts, handshake icons
- Header: "Sales Performance Dashboard" with sales metrics
- Widgets: Revenue charts, pipeline funnel, top opportunities, sales goals

Marketing Dashboard: 
- Color scheme: Purple (#9C27B0) and orange (#FF9800) for creativity
- Icons: Megaphone, target, campaign icons
- Header: "Marketing Campaign Dashboard" with campaign metrics
- Widgets: Campaign ROI, lead generation, email performance, social media stats

Activity Dashboard:
- Color scheme: Teal (#009688) and cyan (#00BCD4) for productivity  
- Icons: Clock, calendar, checklist icons
- Header: "Activity & Task Management" with productivity metrics
- Widgets: Today's agenda, task completion rates, upcoming deadlines, team activity

Collaboration Dashboard:
- Color scheme: Indigo (#3F51B5) and pink (#E91E63) for teamwork
- Icons: People, chat, project icons  
- Header: "Team Collaboration Hub" with team metrics

```
